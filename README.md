# ValidGram.AI (Frontend Only)

This repository hosts the frontend-only version of the ValidGram.AI project. It has been created as an alternative way to showcase the project due to deployment restrictions imposed by free hosting platforms like Render on web scraping and backend functionalities.

The complete project includes both frontend and backend, with functionality for scraping Instagram data and generating predictions using machine learning models. However, this frontend-only repository provides random outputs to simulate how the application looks and behaves, giving a general idea of the user interface and interaction without the backend processing.

# Problems Faced During Deployment

1. Web Scraping Restrictions:
Many free hosting platforms, including Render, disallow web scraping due to ethical and legal concerns, as well as to prevent abuse of their services. Since the full project uses the Instaloader module to scrape Instagram data, it violated these restrictions, leading to deployment issues.


2. Resource Requirements:
Hosting a Flask backend and running machine learning models requires sufficient server resources. Free-tier services often have limited compute power and do not allow such intensive workloads.


3. Alternative Hosting Challenges:
Paid hosting services were not considered due to budget constraints. While free platforms like GitHub Pages are suitable for frontend hosting, they cannot handle backend scripts or real-time processing, necessitating this split repository approach.
